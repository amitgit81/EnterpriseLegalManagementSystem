Great, Amit! With 8 hours a day for 4 weeks and a focus on **enterprise legal management**, we can design an **intensive, hands-on learning path** that builds both **technical depth** and **domain relevance**‚Äîall while staying Windows-compatible.

## üß≠ High-Level Strategy

- **Daily Time Split (8 hrs/day)**:
  - üß† **2 hrs**: Concept learning (videos, docs)
  - üõ†Ô∏è **4 hrs**: Hands-on coding (projects, exercises)
  - üîç **1 hr**: Debugging, reading docs, exploring tools
  - üìì **1 hr**: Notes, reflection, and review

- **Weekly Focus**:
  - Week 1: Core Foundations
  - Week 2: Dynamic Frontend + Perl Scripting
  - Week 3: Full-Stack Integration
  - Week 4: Capstone Project (Enterprise Legal App Prototype)

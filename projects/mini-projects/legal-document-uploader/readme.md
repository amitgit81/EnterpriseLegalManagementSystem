This mini project is part of a full-stack learning path focused on enterprise legal management systems. It demonstrates how to build a simple web-based legal document uploader using HTML, JavaScript, and Perl. The frontend allows users to submit legal documents along with client and case information, while the backend (written in Perl) handles file uploads and stores them securely. This project emphasizes real-world problem-solving by integrating form validation, file handling, and server-side scripting in a practical legal workflow.

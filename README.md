# 4-Week Full-Stack Learning Plan

This repository contains all the code, notes, and projects for the 4-week full-stack learning journey.

You are my software tutor now. I am an engineer with 2 years of experience in java. I am looking at moving to a different company which requires skill in the following areas: • Strong understanding of the Java programming language and object-oriented programming concepts. • Solid experience in designing and implementing micro services architectures • Proficiency with RESTful APIs and web service development. • Experience with databases and proficient in SQL. • Experience with Docker, Git, and CI/CD tools. • Excellent problem-solving and debugging. Strong experience in UI technologies such as HTML5, React, and Angular. Strong knowledge of Java technologies including Spring, Spring Boot, Spring Microservices, and Spring JPA. Proficient in working with JSON and REST APIs. While I can learn the concepts on these topics, I prefer hands-on exercise that would help me solve problems that are as close to real-world as possible. Help me suggesting the following for each topic: 1) Where can I learn the basic concepts to start with 2) What kind of problems can I work on to gain expertise 3) A week-by-week plan for the next 8 weeks to go from basic to intermediate level. I won't mind learning aggressively. I have 8 hours a day for 8 weeks. So, tailor the learning path accordingly, by keeping in mind I have to work for enterprise legal management. divide it day and week wise. So, it will be easy to learn, practise and tract my progress. Create a daily task/learning tracker for my task.
